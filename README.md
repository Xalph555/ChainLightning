A game prototype made for FIT2096 Games Programming unit.
Made in Unreal Engine 5

Currently being updated and polished.

“As a mage studying under the House of Cards, you have spent years learning to channel your magic through playing cards for both offensive and defensive purposes. 
With a particular fondness for lightning, you have developed a technique known as ‘Chain Lightning’ that allows you to use the playing cards you throw out as conduits and amplifiers of electricity. \
Offensively, you can unleash unstable bursts of lightning between your cards to devastate your adversaries. 
Defensively, you can stabilise the lightning to create tangible constructs such as walls and bridges for your own utility. 
The time has come for you to pass your final exam, a dungeon crawl through an ancient temple to retrieve a relic known as the ‘Ace of Spades.’ 
Can you pass the final test of the House of Cards?”

‘Chain Lightning’ is a first-person action game where you play as a mage who has the ability to throw playing cards and conduct lightning between them. 
This can be used offensively to fight against enemies, or defensively to create constructs such as wall and bridges.
